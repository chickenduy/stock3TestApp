# stock3TestApp

Implemented a small app in fetching instruments from Stock3 test API, displaying it in a list using SwiftUI.

UI has been implemented with requirements in mind.

Stretch goals:
- Change exchange has not been implmented
- Pagination has been partially implemented (stops refreshing after a while, not sure why)
- Unit tests have been implmented.
